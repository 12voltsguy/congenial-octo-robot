# Rcare API Interface
An open-source interface layer for integrating with Rcare-compatible endpoints and workflows. Built and maintained by **Ronco Technology Inc.**, this project provides a consistent API façade, reference implementations, and example clients to speed up integrations.

## 📌 Overview
Rcare API Interface standardizes common operations (authentication, event ingestion, status retrieval, and webhook callbacks) and provides tooling for health checks, logging, and error handling. It is designed to be portable, testable, and easy to deploy in modern environments.

**Key goals**
- Provide a clear, stable interface abstraction
- Minimize boilerplate for consumers
- Encourage secure-by-default deployments

## 🚀 Features
- Uniform REST/JSON endpoints with versioning
- Pluggable auth (token, OAuth2 client credentials)
- Webhook delivery & signature verification
- Structured logs and request tracing (OpenTelemetry-friendly)
- Reference clients and examples
